        'Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition. The pancreas makes little or no insulin. Insulin is a hormone the body uses to allow sugar (glucose) to enter cells to produce energy. Different factors, such as genetics and some viruses, may cause type 1 diabetes. Although type 1 diabetes usually appears during childhood or adolescence, it can develop in adults. Treatment is directed toward managing the amount of sugar in the blood using insulin, diet, and lifestyle to prevent complications.',

        "Type 2 diabetes affects the body's sugar utilization, hindering insulin efficacy and potentially leading to high blood sugar levels if untreated. It can cause significant harm to nerves and blood vessels over time. Often preventable, it's influenced by factors like obesity, inadequate exercise, and genetics. Early detection is crucial to mitigate its severe effects. More than 95% of individuals with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. It was previously known as non-insulin-dependent or adult-onset diabetes, increasingly occurring in children today.",

                Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting how the body processes food into energy. It occurs when the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin or the body can't use it effectively. This leads to high blood sugar levels, causing potential health issues like heart disease, vision loss, and kidney disease.

                In 2019, diabetes was directly responsible for 1.5 million deaths, with 48% occurring before age 70. Kidney disease accounted for 460,000 diabetes-related deaths, and raised blood glucose contributed to about 20% of cardiovascular deaths.

                Between 2000 and 2019, age-standardized mortality rates from diabetes increased by 3%, with a 13% rise in lower-middle-income countries. However, the global probability of dying from major noncommunicable diseases decreased by 22% between 2000 and 2019.

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Symptoms of diabetes may manifest suddenly or take years to notice, especially in type 2 diabetes, often starting mildly. Common symptoms include increased thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, fatigue, and unintentional weight loss. Diabetes can severely damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to an elevated risk of heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, and vision loss.
